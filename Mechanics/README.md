ASSEMBLY OF THE HAND

1. Start by opening the BOM file in this folder.
2. With a 3D printer at 40% fill and supports, print all the parts that have &quot;3D printed&quot; as a link. Some parts need to be printed more than once, refer to the quantity column of the BOM to know how many.
3. Cut all the pivot rods with lenghts and quantity as described in the BOM (index 15-16)
4. Separate all the printed parts for each of the fingers where each number is the index in the BOM;

Pinky: 2 – 6 – 4 – 5

Ring finger: 2 – 6 – 4 – 5

Middle finger: 1 – 6 – 4 – 5

Index finger: 1 – 6 – 4 – 5 - 13 - 10 - 18

Thumb: 3 – 6 – 8 – 10 – 9 - 12

The assembly of the fingers is done with rods that are used as pivots in the joints. The servos' moving lever are fixed on the 3D printed levers with nails. The nail's head holds the lever in place and the other end is press fitted into the 3d printed lever.

Assembly of the pinky finger:
1. Attach part 2 and 6 with a 14mm pin. The assembly should be able to move freely.
2. Attach part 2 and 4 together with a 14mm pin.
3. Screw a Servo on part 6.
4. Attach part 5 and 6 with a 14mm pin.
5. With a nail, attach part 4 to the servo screwed on part 6.
6. Screw a servo on part 7.
7. With a nail, attach part 5 to the servo screwed on part 7.

For the four other fingers follow the same steps as for the pinky finger using the parts specified earlier.



1. For the pinky, attach the two phalanxes together at the joint with the bolt of index 17 and the nut of index 19.
2. Assemble a servomotor to the servosocket with the fasteners 24. Make sure the wires are towards the hand.
3. Install the second lever arm on the servomotor with the bolt of index 15 and the nut of index 16. Make sure the curve of the rod is toward the back of the finger, that the head of the bolt is toward the servomotor and that you use the small hole of the rod.
4. Attach the other end of the rod to the last phalanx with the bolt of index 18 and the nut of index 19.
5. Attach the first lever arm of index 1 on the small arm of the first phalanx with the bolt of index 18 and the nut of index 19. Make sure the rod is towards the outside of the phalanx, that you use the bigger hole of the rod and that the curve is towards the back of the finger.
6. Repeat the steps 5-9 for each of the other fingers except for the thumb.
7. For the thumb, attach the two last phalanxes together at the joint with the bolt of index 17 and the nut of index 19.
8. Assemble a servomotor to the two servosockets of the thumb with the fasteners 24. Make sure the wires are towards the hand.
9. Install the third lever arm on the servomotor of the second servosocket with the bolt of index 15 and the nut of index 16. Make sure the curve of the rod is toward the back of the finger, that the head of the bolt is toward the servomotor and that you use the small hole of the rod.
10. Attach the other end of the rod to the last phalanx with the bolt of index 18 and the nut of index 19.
11. Install the second lever arm on the servomotor of the first servosocket with the bolt of index 15 and the nut of index 16. Make sure the curve of the rod is toward the back of the finger, that the head of the bolt is toward the servomotor and that you use the small hole of the rod.
12. Attach the other end of the rod to the second phalanx with the bolt of index 18 and the nut of index 19.
13. Attach the first lever arm on the small arm of the first phalanx with the bolt of index 25 and the nut of index 26. Make sure the rod is towards the back of the phalanx, that you use the bigger hole of the rod and that the curve is towards the outside of the finger.
14. Install a servomotor in each of the 4 servo holders for the palm (index 6). Use the fasteners 24 and make sure that it is installed so that viewed from the top of the servomotor, the wires go to the right.
15. Install the four assemblies made at step 19 on the palm with the fasteners of index 24. Make sure the arms of the servomotors are towards the thumb and that the wires are towards the base of the hand.
16. Install a servomotor on the palm at its spot near the thumb joint. Make sure the wires go towards the hand.
17. Install all the fingers except of the thumb on the palm, use the bolt of index 17 and the nut of index 19.
18. Install the thumb on the palm with the bolt of index 25 and the nut of index 26.
19. Install the lever arms of the fingers on the servomotors of the palm with the bolt of index 15 and the nut of index 16.
20. Install the motors drive on the back of the hand with the four bolts of index 23.
21. Make all the electric connections relating to the hand motors as explained in the electric README.
22. Insert a rod of index BLANK into the forearm until the exposed part of the rod is roughly the same length as the thickness of the base.
23. With the bolts of index 20, install the Open CR and the raspberry pi on the forearm.
24. Insert one of the Dynamixel in the cage located on the forearm until the rotating circle is level with the exterior of the cage.
25. Fasten the 3D printed piece of index BLANK to the Dynamixel installed in step 24 using 2 bolts of index BLANK.
26. Insert the other Dynamixel in the rectangular enclosure in the base, and fasten the gear of index BLANK to said Dynamixel using 2 bolts of index BLANK.
27. Insert 2 bearings of index BLANK in the circular grooves in the base.
28. Place the protruding rod of the forearm into the hols in the base, making sure that the gear installed in step 26 and the gear of the forearm mesh together.
29. Connect the hand to the forearm using a rod of index BLANK, making sure that the driver side of the palm faces the Dynamixel in the forearm.
30. Install the wrist lever arm (index BLANK) between the forearm dynamixel and the protruding hole at the bottom of the palm.
31. Connect the Dynamixels as explained in the electric README.
If desired, you can screw a wooden platform to the base for added stability.
